# WDCC Covid Multilingual Glossary Project

This project is the COVID-19 Multilingual_Glossary project.
This project was created as part of the projects initiative run at WDCC ([wdcc.co.nz]()).

The application allows users to see a table contains translations in different languages. 
Users are also able to search for keywords in real-time and display optional languages. 
In the future, we will allow users to download the table into a .csv file, so users can migrate the data into other formats.

## Accessing the website

The website is currently deployed at cmlg-prod.wdcc.co.nz.

## Module structure

The website is broken into two parts:
- `cmlg-frontend` - A SPA React app
- `cmlg-backend` - A web application written in PHP using the Laravel framework

Navigate into the respective folders to get installation instructions.
